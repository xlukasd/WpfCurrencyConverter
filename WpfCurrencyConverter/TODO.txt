UX/UI:
- improve design of ComboBoxes
- improve overall design with support of UX/UI designer

POSSIBLE "BUSINESS" IMPROVEMENTS:
- better resolve supported currencies by the API
- create Resources for Texts, so that we can do localisation to different languages
- allow only Numbers to be put into TextFields
- implement other Online Converters, in case one is for example not available or something

POSSIBLE TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
- introduce TaskRelayCommand, so that there is no need to have Async/Await Action delegate
- check newest C# features and use them in code (we do not use newest so I am aware about all of them)
